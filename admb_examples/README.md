README
======

This folder contain the ADMB examples.

- Folder names should be the same as TMB example names.
- Each ADMB example should return sdreport output which will be automatically compared with the corresponding TMB example.
- For the same reason, each TMB example should include "sdreport(obj)".
- The order of random effects in TMB and ADMB should be the same.
- Each ADMB example should be timed with and without sdreport so that the sdreport time can be identified.
