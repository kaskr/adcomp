Description: With this tool, a user should be able to quickly implement complex
    random effect models through simple c++ templates. The package combines
    CppAD (c++ automatic differentiation), Eigen (templated matrix-vector
    library) and CHOLMOD (sparse matrix routines available from R) to obtain an
    efficient implementation of the applied Laplace approximation with exact
    derivatives. Key features are: Automatic sparseness detection, parallelism
    through BLAS and parallel user templates.
