==========================================================================

TMB (Template Model Builder) is an R package for fitting statistical
latent variable models to data.  It is inspired by
[ADMB](http://www.admb-project.org). Unlike most other R packages the
model is formulated in C++. This provides great flexibility, but
requires some familiarity with the C/C++ programming language.

These pages describes the C++ part of TMB. The R part is documented
via the ordinary R help system.

- **Related pages**: Introduction to TMB and vignettes (start here if
  you are new). Alternatively available as a
  [**book**](_book/Tutorial.html).
- **Modules**: The C++ documentation is grouped in 'modules'. Here you
  can get an overview of e.g. all TMB macros or all available
  distributions etc.
- **Namespaces**: TMB's package system.
- **Classes**: The C++ classes used in TMB.
- **Files**: The C++ files that constitute TMB.
- **Examples**: List of pre built models that comes with TMB.
- **Search field**: Start typing a keyword, and all matching keywords
  will be listed. Very useful!.
