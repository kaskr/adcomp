Model object {#ModelObject}
============

The TMB core *model object* is the object returned by `MakeADFun()`.
A number of options can be passed to `MakeADFun` to control the
model. The current section walks you through all the
options. Additionally we demonstrate some of the methods that can be
applied to a fitted model object. We shall see how to:

- Fix and collect parameters using the `map` argument.
- Switch parameters back and forth between the inner and outer optimization problem using the arguments `random` and `profile`.
- Set options for the inner optimization problem.
- `sdreport`ing a fitted object.
- Bias correction if random effect estimates.
- Likelihood profiling a fitted object.
