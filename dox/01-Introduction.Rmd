Introduction {#Introduction}
============

TMB (Template Model Builder) is an R package for fitting statistical latent variable models to data. It is strongly inspired by [ADMB](http://www.admb-project.org). Unlike most other R packages the model is formulated in C++. This provides great flexibility, but requires some familiarity with the C/C++ programming language.

* TMB can calculate first and second order derivatives of the likelihood function by [AD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation), or any objective function written in C++.
* The objective function (and its derivatives) can be called from R. Hence, parameter estimation via e.g. `nlminb()` is easy.
* The user can specify that the [Laplace approximation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace_approximation) should be applied to any subset of the function arguments. 
  * Yields marginal likelihood in latent variable model.
* Standard deviations of any parameter, or derived parameter, obtained by the ['delta method'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_method).
* Pre and post-processing of data done in R.
* TMB is based on state-of-the art software: [CppAD](http://www.coin-or.org/CppAD/), [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page), ...

A more general introduction including the underlying theory used in TMB can be found in this [paper](https://www.jstatsoft.org/index.php/jss/article/view/v070i05/v70i05.pdf). 


Tutorial {#Tutorial}
========

A TMB project consists of an R file (*.R) and a C++ file (*.cpp).  The
R file does pre- and post processing of data in addition to maximizing
the log-likelihood contained in *.cpp. See [Examples](#Examples) for more
details.  All R functions are documented within the standard help
system in R.  This tutorial describes how to write the C++ file, and
assumes familiarity with C++ and to some extent with R.

The purpose of the C++ program is to evaluate the objective function,
i.e. the negative log-likelihood of the model. The program is compiled
and called from R, where it can be fed to a function minimizer like
`nlminb()`.

The objective function should be of the following C++ type:

```{.cpp}
#include <TMB.hpp>

template<class Type>
Type objective_function<Type>::operator() ()
{
.... Here goes your C++ code ..... 
}
```

The first line includes the source code for the whole TMB package (and
all its dependencies).  The objective function is a templated class
where `<Type>` is the data type of both the input values and
the return value of the objective function.  This allows us to
evaluate both the objective function and its derivatives using the
same chunk of C++ code (via the AD package
[CppAD](http://www.coin-or.org/CppAD/Doc/doxydoc/html/index.html)). The
technical aspects of this are hidden from the user. There is however
one aspect that surprises the new TMB user. When a constant like "1.2"
is used in a calculation that affects the return value it must be
"cast" to Type:

```{.cpp}
Type nll;           // Define variable that holds the return value (neg. log. lik)
nll = Type(1.2);    // Assign value 1.2; a cast is needed.
```

## Obtaining data and parameter values from R
Obviously, we will need to pass both data and parameter values to the
objective function.  This is done through a set of macros that TMB
defines for us.

### List of data macros

```{r, results='asis', echo=FALSE}
tmp <- unlist(lapply(dir("../TMB/inst/include", full=TRUE), readLines))
tmp <- grep('^#define DATA_', tmp, value=TRUE)
tmp <- sub("^#define ","",tmp)
tmp <- sub("\\(.*","",tmp)
tmp <- tmp[-grep("INDICATOR",tmp)]
tmp <- sort(tmp)
tmp <- paste(paste0("`",tmp,"()`"), collapse=", ")
cat("> ", tmp)
```

### List of parameter macros

```{r, results='asis', echo=FALSE}
tmp <- unlist(lapply(dir("../TMB/inst/include", full=TRUE), readLines))
tmp <- grep('^#define PARAMETER', tmp, value=TRUE)
tmp <- sub("^#define ","",tmp)
tmp <- sub("\\(.*","",tmp)
tmp <- sort(tmp)
tmp <- paste(paste0("`",tmp,"()`"), collapse=", ")
cat("> ", tmp)
```

To see which macros are available start typing
`DATA_` or `PARAMETER_` in the Doxygen search field of
your browser (you may need to refresh the browser window between each
time you make a new search). A simple example if you want to read a
vector of numbers (doubles) is the following

```{.cpp}
DATA_VECTOR(x);     // Vector x(0),x(1),...,x(n-1), where n is the length of x
```

Note that all vectors and matrices in TMB uses a **zero-based**
indexing scheme.  It is not necessary to explicitly pass the dimension
of `x`, as it can be retrieved inside the C++ program:

```{.cpp}
int n = x.size();
```

## An extended C++ language
TMB extends C++ with functionality that is important for formulating
likelihood functions. You have different toolboxes available:

- Standard C++ used for infrastructure like loops etc.
- Vector, matrix and array library (see [Matrices and arrays](#matrix_arrays))
- Probability distributions (see [Densities](#Densities) and [R style distributions](#R_style_distribution))

In addition to the variables defined through the `DATA_` or
`PARAMETER_` macros there can be "local" variables, for which
ordinary C++ scoping rules apply.  There must also be a variable that
holds the return value (neg. log. likelihood).

```{.cpp}
DATA_VECTOR(x);               // Vector x(0), x(1), ..., x(n-1)
Type tmp = x(1);
Type nll = tmp * tmp; 
```

As in ordinary C++ local variable tmp must be assigned a value before
it can enter into a calculation.

## Statistical modelling
TMB can handle complex statistical problems with hierarchical
structure (latent random variables) and multiple data sources.  Latent
random variables must be continuous (discrete distributions are not
handled).  The `PARAMETER_` macros are used to pass two types
of parameters.

- **Parameters**: to be estimated by maximum likelihood. These include
  fixed effects and variance components in the mixed model
  literature. They will also correspond to hyper parameters with
  non-informative priors in the Bayesian literature.
- **Latent random variables**: to be integrated out of the likelihood
  using a Laplace approximation.

Which of these are chosen is controlled from R, via the
`random` argument to the function `MakeADFun`. However,
on the C++ side it is usually necessary to assign a probability
distribution to the parameter.

The purpose of the C++ program is to calculate the (negative) joint
density of data and latent random variables. Each datum and individual
latent random effect gives a contribution to log likelihood, which may
be though of as a "distribution assignment" by users familiar with
software in the BUGS family.

```{.cpp}
PARAMETER_VECTOR(u);          // Latent random variable 
Type nll = Type(0);           // Return value
nll -= dnorm(u(0),0,1,true)   // Distributional assignment: u(0) ~ N(0,1) 
```

The following rules apply:

- Distribution assignments do not need to take place before the latent
  variable is used in a calculation.
- More complicated distributional assignments are allowed, say
  *u(0)-u(1) ~ N(0,1)*, but this requires the user to have a deeper
  understanding of the probabilistic aspects of the model.
- For latent variables only normal distributions should be used
  (otherwise the Laplace approximation will perform poorly). For
  response variables all probability distributions (discrete or
  continuous) are allowed.  If a non-gaussian latent is needed the
  "transformation trick" can be used.
- The namespaces [R style distributions](#R_style_distribution) and [Densities](#Densities) contain
  many probability distributions, including multivariate normal
  distributions. For probability distributions not available from
  these libraries, the user can use raw C++ code:
    ```{.cpp}
    DATA_VECTOR(y);                   // Data vector
    Type nll = Type(0);               // Return value
    nll -= sum(-log(Type(1.0)+y*y));  // y are i.i.d. Cauchy distributed
    ```

See [Toolbox](#Toolbox) for more about statistical modelling.


The structure of TMB {#Structure_TMB}
====================

This documentation only covers the TMB specific code, not
[CppAD](http://www.coin-or.org/CppAD/Doc/doxydoc/html/index.html)
or
[Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/group__TutorialMatrixClass.html)
These packages have their own documentation, which may be relevant.
In particular, some of the standard functions like `sin()` and `cos()`
are part of CppAD, and are hence not documented through TMB.

![TMB components](figure/TMB_components.png)


Matrices and arrays {#matrix_arrays}
===================

## Relationship to R
In R you can apply both matrix multiplication (`%*%`) and elementwise
multiplication (`*`) to objects of type "matrix", i.e. it is the
operator that determines the operation.  In TMB we instead have two
different types of objects, while the multiplication operator (`*`) is
the same:

- `matrix`: linear algebra
- `array`: elementwise operations; () and [] style indexing.
- `vector`: can be used in linear algebra with `matrix`, but at the
  same time admits R style element-wise operations.

See the file `r doxylink("matrix_arrays.cpp")` for examples of use.

## Relationship to Eigen
The TMB types `matrix` and `array` (in dimension 2) inherits
directly from the the Eigen types Matrix and Array. The advanced user
of TMB will benefit from familiarity with the
[Eigen documentation](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/group__TutorialMatrixClass.html).
Note that arrays of dimension 3 or higher are specially implemented in
TMB, i.e. are not directly inherited from Eigen.


R style probability distributions {#R_style_distribution}
=================================

Attempts have been made to make the interface (function name and
arguments) as close as possible to that of R.

- The densities (`d...`) are provided both in the discrete and
  continuous case, cumulative distributions (`p...`) and inverse
  cumulative distributions (`q...`)  are provided only for continuous
  distributions.
- Scalar and `vector` arguments (in combination) are supported, but
  not `array` or `matrix` arguments.
- The last argument (of type `int`) corresponds to the `log`
  argument in R: 1=logaritm, 0=ordinary scale. `true` (logaritm) and
  `false` (ordinary scale) can also be used.
- Vector arguments must all be of the same length (no recycling of
  elements). If vectors of different lengths are used an "out of
  range" error will occur, which can be picked up by the debugger.
- `DATA_IVECTOR()` and `DATA_INTEGER()` cannot be used with
  probability distributions, except possibly for the last (log)
  argument.
- An example:
    ```{.cpp}
    DATA_SCALAR(y);
    DATA_VECTOR(x);
    vector<Type> rate(10);
    matrix<Type> rate_matrix(10, 10);
    dexp(y, rate, true);                    // OK, returns vector of length 10 of log-densities
    dexp(x, rate, true);                    // OK if x is length 10
    dexp(x, rate_matrix, true);             // Error, matrix arguments not allowed
    ```
- To sum over elements in the vector returned use
    ```{.cpp}
    sum(dexp(x,rate));
    ```


Multivariate distributions {#Densities}
==========================

The namespace

```{.cpp} 
using namespace density;
``` 

gives access to a variety of multivariate normal distributions:

- Multivariate normal distributions specified via a covariance matrix
  (structured or unstructured).
- Autoregressive (AR) processes.
- Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRF) defined on regular grids or
  defined via a (sparse) precision matrix.
- Separable covariance functions, i.e. time-space separability.

These seemingly unrelated concepts are all implemented via the notion
of a `distribution`, which explains why they are placed in the same
namespace. You can combine two `distributions`, and this lets you
build up complex multivariate distributions using extremely compact
notation. Due to the flexibility of the approach it is more abstract
than other parts of TMB, but here it will be explained from
scratch. Before looking at the different categories of multivariate
distributions we note the following which is of practical importance:

- All members in the `density` namespace return the **negative** log
  density, opposed to the univariate densities in [R style distributions](#R_style_distribution).

## Multivariate normal distributions
Consider a zero-mean multivariate normal distribution
with covariance matrix *Sigma* (symmetric positive definite),
that we want to evaluate at _x_:

```{.cpp} 
int n = 10;
vector<Type> x(n);           // Evaluation point           
x.fill(0.0);                 // Point of evaluation: x = (0,0,...,0)
```

The negative log-normal density is evaluated as follows:

```{.cpp} 
using namespace density;
matrix<Type> Sigma(n,n);     // Covariance matrix
// ..... User must assign value to Sigma here
res = MVNORM(Sigma)(x);      // Evaluate negative log likelihod
```

In the last line `MVNORM(Sigma)` should be interpreted as a
multivariate density, which via the last parenthesis `(x)` is
evaluated at `x`.  A less compact way of expressing this is

```{.cpp}
MVNORM_t<Type> your_dmnorm(Sigma);
res = your_dmnorm(x);
```

in which `your_dmnorm` is a variable that holds the "density". 

Note, that the latter way (using the `MVNORM_t`) is _more efficient_
when you need to evaluate the density more than once, i.e. for different values of `x`.
    
_Sigma_ can be parameterized in different ways. Due to the symmetry of
*Sigma* there are at most *n(n+1)/2* free parameters (*n* variances
and *n(n-1)/2* correlation parameters). If you want to estimate all of
these freely (modulo the positive definite constraint) you can use
`UNSTRUCTURED_CORR()` to specify the correlation matrix, and
`VECSCALE()` to specify variances. `UNSTRUCTURED_CORR()` takes as
input a vector a dummy parameters that internally is used to build the
correlation matrix via its cholesky factor.

```{.cpp} 
using namespace density;
int n = 10;
vector<Type> unconstrained_params(n*(n-1)/2);  // Dummy parameterization of correlation matrix
vector<Type> sds(n);                           // Standard deviations
res = VECSCALE(UNSTRUCTURED_CORR(unconstrained_params),sds)(x);
```

If all elements of `dummy_params` are estimated we are in effect
estimating a full correlation matrix without any constraints on its
elements (except for the mandatory positive definiteness).  The actual
value of the correlation matrix, but not the full covariance matrix,
can easily be assessed using the `.cov()` operator

```{.cpp} 
matrix<Type> Sigma(n,n);
Sigma = UNSTRUCTURED_CORR(unconstrained_params).cov();
REPORT(Sigma);                                         // Report back to R session
```

## Autoregressive processes
Consider a stationary univariate Gaussian AR1 process
*x(t),t=0,...,n-1*. The stationary distribution is choosen so that:

- *x(t)* has mean 0 and variance 1 (for all *t*).

The multivariate density of the vector *x* can be evaluated as follows

```{.cpp} 
int n = 10;
using namespace density;
 
vector<Type> x(n);           // Evaluation point
x.fill(0.0);                 // Point of evaluation: x = (0,0,...,0)
Type rho = 0.2;              // Correlation parameter
res = AR1(rho)(x);           // Evaluate negative log-density of AR1 process at point x 
```

Due to the assumed stationarity the correlation parameter must
satisfy:

- **Stationarity** constraint: -1 < *rho* < 1

Note that *cor[x(t),x(t-1)] = rho*. 

The `SCALE()` function can be used to set the standard deviation.

```{.cpp} 
Type sigma = 2.1;            // standard deviation of x
res = SCALE(AR1(rho),sigma)(x);
```

Now, *var[x(t)] = sigma^2*. Because all elements of `x` are scaled by
the same constant we use SCALE rather than VECSCALE.

#### Multivariate AR1 processes
This is the first real illustration of how distributions can be used
as building blocks to obtain more complex distributions. Consider the
*p* dimensional AR1 process

```{.cpp}
int n = 10;                   // Number of time steps
int p=3;                      // dim(x)
array<Type> x(p,n);           // Evaluation point
```

The columns in `x` refer to the different time points.  We then
evaluate the (negative log) joint density of the time series.

```{.cpp}
MVNORM_t<Type> your_dmnorm(Sigma);  // Density of x(t) 
Type phi;                           // Correlation parameter
res = AR1(phi,your_dmnorm)(x);
```

Note the following:

- We have introduced an intermediate variable `your_dmnorm`, which
  holds the p-dim density marginal density of *x(t)*.  This is a
  zero-mean normal density with covariance matrix `Sigma`.
- All *p* univarite time series have the same serial correlation *phi*.
- The multivariate process *x(t)* is stationary in the same sense as
  the univariate AR1 process described above.

#### Higher order AR processes

There also exists `r doxylink("ARk_t")` of arbitrary autoregressive order.

## Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRF)
GMRF may be defined in two ways:

1. Via a (sparse) precision matrix Q.
2. Via a d-dimensional lattice.

For further details please see `r doxylink("GMRF_t")`. Under 1) a sparse Q
corresponding to a Matern covariance function can be obtained via the
`r doxylink("R_inla")` namespace.

## Separable construction of covariance (precision) matrices
A typical use of separability is to create space-time models with a
sparse precision matrix. Details are given in `r doxylink("SEPARABLE_t")`. Here
we give a simple example.

Assume that we study a quantity `x` that changes both in space and
time. For simplicity we consider only a one-dimensional space.  We
discretize space and time using equidistant grids, and assume that the
distance between grid points is 1 in both dimensions. We then define
an `AR1(rho_s)` process in space and one in time `AR1(rho_t)`.  The
separable assumption is that two points `x1` and `x2`, separated in
space by a distance `ds` and in time by a distance `dt`, have
correlation given by

`rho_s^ds*rho_t^dt`

This is implemented as

```{.cpp}
using namespace density;
int n_s = 10;                   // Number of grid points in space
int n_t = 10;                   // Number of grid points in time
Type rho_s = 0.2;               // Correlation in space
Type rho_t = 0.4;               // Correlation in time

array<Type> x(n_s,n_t);
x.setZero();                    // x = 0

res = SEPARABLE(AR1(rho_t),AR1(rho_s))(x);
```

Note that the arguments to `SEPARABLE()` are given in the opposite order
to the dimensions of `x`.


Example collection {#Examples}
==================

- A list of all examples is found on the "Examples" tab on the top of the page. 
- Locations of example files: `adcomp/tmb_examples` and `adcomp/TMB/inst/examples`.
- For each example there is both a `.cpp` **and** a `.R` file. Take for instance the linear regression example:
- **C++ template**
    `r include_source("../tmb_examples/linreg.cpp", indent=4)`
- **Controlling R code**
    `r include_source("../tmb_examples/linreg.R", indent=4)`
- To run this example use the R command
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    source("linreg.R")
    ```

## Example overview

```{R results='asis', echo=FALSE}
examples <- dir("../tmb_examples", pattern=".cpp$", recursive=TRUE, full.names=TRUE)
description <- sub("^//[ ]*", "", sapply(paste0(examples), function(x)readLines(x)[1]))
tab <- cbind(Example=doxylink(basename(examples)), Description=description)
rownames(tab) <- NULL
ord <- order(sub(".cpp","",basename(examples)))
knitr::kable(tab[ord, ])
```

Compilation and run time errors {#Errors}
===============================

The R interface to the debugger (gdb) is documented as part of the R
help system, i.e. you can type `?gdbsource` in R to get info. The
current document only adresses isses that the relate to C++.

## Compilation errors
It may be hard to understand the compilation errors for the following
reasons

- The Eigen libraries use templated C++ which generate non-intuitive
  error messages.

## Run time errors
Run time errors are broadly speaking of two types:

- Out-of-bounds (you are "walking out of an array")
- Floating point exceptions 

You can use the debugger to locate both types of errors, but the
procedure is a little bit different in the two cases. The following
assumes that you have the GNU debugger `gdb` installed.

### Out-of-bounds error
An example is:

```{.cpp}
vector<Type> y(4);
y(5);                // 5 is not a valid index value here
```

This will cause TMB and R to crash with the following error message:

> TMB has received an error from Eigen. The following condition was not met:
> index >= 0 && index < size()
> Please check your matrix-vector bounds etc., or run your program through a debugger.
> Aborted (core dumped)

So, you must restart R and give the commands

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(TMB)
gdbsource("my_project.R")
```

> \#5  objective_function<double>::operator() (this=<optimized out>) at nan_error_ex.cpp:11

and you can see that the debugger points to line number 11 in the .cpp
file.  `gdbsource()` is an R function that is part of TMB.

### Floating point exception
If you on the other hand perform an illegal mathematical operation,
such as

```{.cpp}
Type f = sqrt(-1.);
```

R will not crash, but the objective function will return a NaN value.
However, you will not know in which part of your C++ code the error
occured.  By including the `fenv.h` library (part of many C++
compilers, but can otherwise be downloaded from
http://www.scs.stanford.edu/histar/src/uinc/fenv.h)

`nan_error_ex.cpp`:
`r include_source("../tmb_syntax/nan_error_ex.cpp")`

a floating point exception will be turned into an actual error that
can be picked up by the debugger.  There are only two extra lines that
need to be included ("//Extra line needed" in the above example).

When we try to run this program in the usual way, the program crashes:

```{r eval=FALSE}
source("nan_error_ex.R")
```

> Floating point exception (core dumped)
> tmp3>

At this stage you should run the debugger to find out that the
floating point exception occurs at line number 14:

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(TMB)
gdbsource("nan_error_ex.R")
```

> \#1  0x00007ffff0e7eb09 in objective_function<double>::operator() (this=<optimized out>) at nan_error_ex.cpp:14




Toolbox {#Toolbox}
=======

First read the *Statistical Modelling* section of [Tutorial](#Tutorial).

### Non-normal latent variables (random effects)

The underlying latent random variables in TMB must be Gaussian for the
Laplace approximation to be accurate. To obtain other distributions,
say a gamma distribution, the "transformation trick" can be used. We
start out with normally distributed variables `u` and transform these
into new variables `w` via the `pnorm` and `qgamma` functions as
follows:

```{.cpp}
PARAMETER_VECTOR(u);                             // Underlying latent random variables 
Type nll=Type(0.0);
nll -= sum(dnorm(u,Type(0),Type(1),true));       // Assign N(0,1) distribution u 
vector<Type> v = pnorm(u,Type(0),Type(1),true);  // Uniformly distributed variables (on [0,1])
vector<Type> w = qgamma(v,shape,scale,true);
```

`w` now has a gamma distribution.

### Discrete latent variables

The Laplace approximation can not be applied to discrete latent
variables that occur in mixture models and HMMs (Hidden Markov
models). However, such likelihoods have analytic expressions, and may
be coded up in TMB.  TMB would still calculate the exact gradient of
the HMM likelihood.

### Mixture models 

Although mixture models are a special case of discrete latent variable
models, they do deserve special attention. Consider the case that we
want a mixture of two zero-mean normal distributions (with different
standard deviations).  This can be implemented as:

```{.cpp}
DATA_VECTOR(x);              			
PARAMETER_VECTOR(sigma);      // sigma0 og sigma1
PARAMETER(p);                 // Mixture proportion of model 0
Type nll=Type(0.0);
nll -= sum( log(      p  * dnorm(x, Type(0), sigma(0), false)
               + (1.0-p) * dnorm(x, Type(0), sigma(1), false) ) );
```

### Time series
Autoregressive (AR) processes may be implemented using the compact
notation of section [Densities](#Densities). The resulting AR process may be
applied both in the observational part and in the distribution of a
latent variable.

Nonlinear time must be implemented from scratch, as in the example
`r doxylink("thetalog.cpp")`

### Spatial models
TMB has strong support for spatial model and space-time models via the
`GMRF()` and `SEPARABLE()` functions, and the notion of a
`distribution`. The reader is referred to section [Densities](#Densities) for
details and examples.

### I know R but not C++

Summary of how syntax differs between R and C++:

```{.cpp}
              R code             C++/TMB code

Comments      #                  //                          // Comment symbol
Constants     3.4                Type(3.4);                  // Explicit casting recommended in TMB
Scalar        x = 5.2            Type x = Type(5.2);         // Variables must have type
Arrays        x = numeric(10)    vector<Type> x(10);         // C++ code here does NOT initialize to 0
Indexing      x[1]+x[10]         x(0)+x(9);                  // C++ indexing is zero-based
Loops         for(i in 1:10)     for(int i=1;i<=10;i++)      // Integer i must be declared in C++
Increments    x[1] = x[1] + 3    x(0) += 3.0;                // += -= *= /= incremental operators in C++
```

It is important to note the following difference compared to R:

> Vectors, matrices and arrays are **not** zero-initialized in C++.

A zero initialized object is created using Eigens `setZero()`:

```{.cpp}
matrix<Type> m(4,5);
m.setZero();

> Some operations in C++ have special integer versions.

```{.cpp}
Type x = 11 / 3;    // Integer division
REPORT(x)           // x=3
```

When writing a floating point literal such as `11` better use `11.`.

```{.cpp}
Type x = 034;       // Octal representation
REPORT(x);          // x=28
```

### I know C++

TMB specific C++ include:

- You should not use `if(x)` statements where `x` is a `PARAMETER`,
  or is derived from a variable of type `PARAMETER`. (It is OK to use
  `if` on `DATA` types, however.)  TMB will remove the `if(x)`
  statement, so the code will produce unexpected results.
