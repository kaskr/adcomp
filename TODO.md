TODO
====
- **DONE** Upgrade to recent cppad, to get the abs/sign bugfix of version 2013-11-27.
- **DONE** Eliminate Wall warnings.
- Make instructions how to disable Wall compiler flag, and more generally how to locate global Makeconf and create local Makevars.
- Roxygen documentation:
  - The use of dyn.load is confusing (add 'seealso' to ?compile)
  - The summary method of sdreport is undocumented.
- **DONE** Make it work on common platforms (Linux, Windows, Mac OS X).
- Clean up R-code: newton, options, MakeADFun: class(output).
- MakeADFun: Call dyn.load if DLL not loaded (?)
- parList: use last.par.best as default (?)
- **DONE** parallel_start.hpp does not yet have parallel Hessian member.
- **DONE** Metis symbolic analysis with 3d example.
- Move methods, such as "parList", out of the object.
- **DONE** Rinterface should remember to set DLL="..."
- **DONE** sdreport() on R-side to get sd of ADREPORT().
- **DONE** solveSubset to get sd's of all random effects.
- Make importance sampler work in high dim - need a GMRFsample.
- Compile and testing workflow:
  - **DONE** Eliminate need to restart R.
  - **DONE** Give better message if PARAMETER(name) evaluates to NULL.
  - **DONE** Improve compile times by either precompiling or allow incomplete compilations.
  - **DONE** Array bounds checking option
- **DONE** template() should never overwrite existing file.
- **DONE** Review kaspers class extensions of Eigen classes, in particular array<Type>, matrix<Type> and vector<Type>
  - **DONE** Consistency between matrix and array fastest running dimensions.
  - **DONE** Desired behaviour of overloaded operations e.g. pointwise multiply vs matrix multiply.
  - Automatic cast from array to vector.
- Make simple example of how to include "adjoint code". pexp(x,lambda) is a good example (cum. dist. function exp. distr)
- Think about general features for calculating residuals, along the line of Kasper's ideas. 
- New feature 'exportRpackage()' to wrap user template into a self contained R-package, optionally as standalone (independent of TMB package). By default linking to the TMB installation for smaller package size.
- **DONE** Implement atomic AD operators of entire Rmath special function library. Example: D_x(psigamma(x,n))=psigamma(x,n+1)
- **DONE** Implement atomic AD operators of certain matrix operations (linking to BLAS) to e.g. better handle templates using multivariate normal distribution with dense covariance matrices.
- **DONE** Implement atomic AD operator of matrix exponential.
- Package should pass "make check"/"R CMD check" without warnings.
- Make unary functions work on arrays and preserve dimension.
- Disable array methods that give unexpected results (e.g. .Block() ).
- ```sdreport(...,bias.correct=TRUE)``` does not work in parallel (currently need prior call ```openmp(1)```).
